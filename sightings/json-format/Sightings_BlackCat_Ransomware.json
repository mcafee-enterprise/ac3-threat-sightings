    "description": "Threat Sighting for BlackCat Ransomware TTPs based on internal research and external reports. BlackCat is written in Rust and promoted on Russian-speaking hacking forums. The ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) pays affiliates depending on the size of the ransom payment. The malware is highly configurable, with the ability to use different encryption routines, spread between computers, kill virtual machines and ESXi VMs, and automatically wipe ESXi snapshots to prevent recovery. BlackCat uses a triple-extortion tactic where they steal data before encrypting devices and threat to publish the data if a ransom is not paid. As an additional extortion method, the threat actors threaten to DDoS victims until they pay a ransom. Source- Bleeping Computer.",
