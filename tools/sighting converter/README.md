# Threat Sighting converter

This script allows you to create different outcomes from your threat sightings. We believe that threat sightings and their visual representations help to better understand the threats. For this reason, we have implemented different integrations with formats and standards used in the cybersecurity industry.

# Installation

Python3 is needed to run this script.

To install the dependencies run the following command.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: We recommend the use of virtualenv to install the dependencies.

## Exports

#### Generate ATT&CK MITRE Navigator Layer

```
> python sightingConverter.py -f sighting_Guildma.yml --attack
```

```
[+] Generated navigator layer tsOutcome_ATT&CK_Sightings_AC3.json file
```

**IMPORTANT:** The file called `_layer.json` is the layer used to create the navigator. Ensure that is in the same path of your script.

The file `ATT&CK_Sightings_AC3.json` is generated in the same path where the script was executed. You can view the matrix on the official website of MITRE and import the JSON file.

MITRE ATT&CKÂ® Navigator: https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/

All techniques are displayed in a heatmap format based on the number of occurrences within the sighting.

![visualization_mitre1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcafee-enterprise/ac3-threat-sightings/main/tools/sighting%20converter/imgs/navigator_visualization1.png)

If you put the mouse over a technique, you will be able to see all the observables associated with that technique. This visualization help you to see the most used techniques and their behaviors.

#### Weapon filter

```
> python sightingConverter.py -f sighting_Guildma.yml --weapon powershell.exe
```

```
********************
+ Behavior: PowerShell command executed to load malicious .hta file
+ type: Process Created
+ Technique: T1059.001 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell
+ Procedures
         |_ parentProcess: C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe
         |_ process: C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe
         |_ cmdLine: ['powershell  -Command "& \'C:\\Users\\Public\\Videos\\YqW.Hta\' ']
********************

```

The output of this parameter are all the behaviors of the weapon selected. In this case, we can see the behaviors related to `powershell.exe`.
